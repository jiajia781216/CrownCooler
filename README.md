# CrownCooler - Ring shaped CPAP cooling duct for Voron 3D printers
This mod is designed to adapt a fan mounted somewhere on the frame, through a CPAP tube and onto a "crown" shaped cooling duct. It has been designed for the Voron 2.4 and Voron Trident series of printers, mounting directly to the stealthburner X carriage.

This mod was developed to:
- be compatible with standard voron stealthburner carriage
- be compatible with all extruder combinations that are compatible with the stealthburner system, (CW1, CW2, Orbiter, LGX Lite, etc.)
- mount a Rapido HF/UHF hot end & Dragon SF/HF/UHF hot end 
- improve overall cooling performance by accomodating very large fans and intaking cool air from outside the heated enclosure
- provide uniform cooling from all directions
- be lightweight and easy to maintain
- work with klickyprobe & euclid probe.

The design of the crown duct creates a fluid vortex at the tip of the nozzle, resulting in high cooling performance. It was designed using commercial CFD software, and validated experimentally. There is a secondary air cooling route fed by the part cooling fan to prevent warping of the duct from hot end heat. 


**This mod is still a BETA. Expect issues - but let me know about them so I can fix them.**

## Dev Update (Mar 2025)
I've uploaded the Fusion 360 native CAD assembly.

I am currently testing the Dragon SF/HF version. Working well so far. 
My Rapido hotend is damaged so I can no longer test that one personally.


## Dev Update (Sept 2024)
I have added a trimmed down X carriage mount to fit the new duct. I've also added a adapter mount for the Euclid Probes. Let me know if there is interest for a Klicky mount and I will make one.


## Dev Update (August 2024)
I have created a Dragon (SF/HF) toolhead mount.

Furthermore, I have created a new duct design. This combines the ideas I have created in the crown design, along with the tentacool duct. I'm still working on airflow optimisation but so far the performance is good.

The Dragon mount will be released in the coming days, and the duct will be released after some more testing.

## Dev Update (July 2024)
After a lot of experimenting with other cooling designs such as the [Tentacool](https://github.com/MirageC79/HextrudORT/tree/main/files/COOLING/TENTACOOL), I plan on merging the ideas produced from the V2.5 cooler, with the ideas from the Tentacool. I don't want to give a release date as it's a slow process, but a release is on the hoizon. 

Until then, I will build in support for other hot ends (dragon HF, Rapido HF, Rapido UHF for now. I am open to further requests). These will be release as soon as possible. The V2.5 duct and a modified Tentacool duct will be included in this release. I expect to release this by the end of July.


## V2.5 Update (February 2024)
The flow path has been updated in the latest version. It provides approximately **twice the cooling performance compared to the previous version!** In my testing, I was able to print 80degree angles at 30% fan rate (WS7040) with an enclosure temperature of 70C, 0.6mm nozzle size and 0.3mm layer height.

## CFD results:
You can clearly see a vortex being formed around the ring. This creates a cycle of air that rapidly carries heat from the printed part, allowing printong of steep overhangs.

# Part Cooling Fan Options

There are a number of part cooling fan options to choose from, depending on your intended use case.

### 4028 fan

<img width="250" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-23 at 6 24 17 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12782053/224202478-e5becb0b-ecc1-4771-b074-3288d9c18826.png">


A "medium" performance option is to use a 4028 fan on the end of the CPAP tube. This solution is best suited for ABS and similiar materials that do not require high amounts of part cooling. I do not recommend this option for printing PLA at high speeds.
A 4028 to CPAP tube adapter part is included in the STL files folder.

Recommended 4028 fans include:
- Sanyo 9GAX0412P3S001
- Delta FFB0412UHN-SM36

### 7040 blower fan

A "high" performance is to use a 7040 blower fan on the end of the CPAP tube. This solution is best suited for printing PLA & PETG & ABS at very high speeds.

A 7040 blower fan mount can be found [here.](https://www.printables.com/model/324265-ws7040-centrifugal-blower-fan-mount)

I recommend the WS7040 along with the controller board. I purchased mine from [Trianglelab here.](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003822117604.html)

# BOM
- Coming soon...
  
# Installation instructions 
- This mod uses the standard stealthburner X carriage parts. T
- This mod should work with all types of extruder mounting parts, including CW2 (however, I have not yet tested it). I use the orbiter V2 extruder mount found [here](https://github.com/sneakytreesnake/StealthOrbiter).
- Print the cooling duct with no supports, file in STL folder. Use standard Voron print setting (0.6mm nozzle is acceptable)
- Only euclid and klicky probes are compatible at the moment. Use the offset klicky mount for HF hot ends, use the tall offset clock mount for UHF hot ends.
